  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    I am a musician, and I chose to dedicate my life to music.
    In order to do so, I left my home country, Argentina,
    and moved to Germany to continue my postgraduate studies in percussion.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few months after arriving in Cologne — the city where I have lived since 2015 —
    I went through a deep crisis that made it impossible for me to step onto the stage and play.
    Or rather: every time I did, a strong feeling appeared that everything was wrong —
    that I was not enough, that I was a failure, that this was not for me.
  </p>

  <p>
    That moment marked the beginning of a process that, ten years later, is still ongoing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, my musical career began to grow:
    collaborations with important ensembles and orchestras in Europe,
    projects connected to Latin America, new opportunities.
    But the most decisive work was not only musical — it was personal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therapy, courses, workshops, encounters, doubts, setbacks, and questions
    were all part of a path that led me to a simple but fundamental realization:
    I could not continue developing my music without stopping to listen
    to what was happening inside me.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am where I am today because I learned to give space to that
    and to work with it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Was it necessary to go so far away to understand this?
    To travel those 14,000 kilometers, leave everything behind,
    and start again in a foreign and cold country?
  </p>

  <p>
    With time, I understood that it was.
    It was probably the most difficult decision I have ever made —
    and also the most important one.
  </p>

  <p>
    From that place, Mental Notes was born.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, I work with musicians and artists who are going through similar processes:
    people who feel that something gets stuck,
    that discomfort appears,
    that music stops being a livable space.
    I deeply believe that a musical career is not built solely
    through practice and technical perfection,
    but through a personal development
    that can truly sustain that path over time.

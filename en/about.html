  <h1>I’m Ramón Gardella</h1>

  <p>
    I am a person who chose to dedicate his life to music.
    To do so, I left my home country, Argentina, and moved to Germany
    to continue my postgraduate studies in percussion.
    A few months after arriving in Cologne (the city where I have lived since 2015),
    I went through a deep crisis that prevented me from stepping onto the stage and playing.
    Or rather, every time I did step on stage, I felt that everything I was doing was wrong,
    that I was a failure, and that this path was not for me.
  </p>

  <p>
    From that moment on, a process began in my life that has led me,
    ten years later, to become a successful musician with a growing career,
    collaborating and performing with important ensembles and orchestras throughout Europe,
    and developing artistic collaborations with countries across Latin America.
  </p>

  <p>
    This process — which included therapy, courses, workshops, meetings,
    setbacks, and more doubts than certainties —
    was not only musical, but deeply personal.
    It was a process that made me realize I could not continue developing my music
    without paying attention to what I was feeling
    and to what was happening inside me.
  </p>

  <p class="emphasis">
    I am where I am today because I chose to listen to what was happening within me
    and to work consciously on it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Did I really have to go that far to realize this?
    Was it necessary to travel 14,000 kilometers and leave everything behind
    to start over in a foreign and cold country?
    Yes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking back now, I can say it was the best —
    and the most difficult — decision I have ever made.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now that I have come to understand many aspects of this process,
    I feel ready to support those who are going through something similar
    and/or resonate with this experience.
  </p>

  <p class="closing">
    A successful musical career is not built solely through study
    and technical mastery of an instrument,
    but through personal development alongside it.
  </p>

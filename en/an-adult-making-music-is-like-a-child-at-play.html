  <h1>An adult making music is like a child at play</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">(or it should be)</p>

  <p>The act of making music brings back an essential experience of childhood — although filtered through greater awareness: play.</p>

  <p>When a child plays, they are not simply entertaining themselves: they are building their own world, with internal rules, a particular logic, and also its zones of disorder. In that playful space, nothing external exists; even when others are involved, everyone belongs to the same universe of play. When play is authentic, there is no “outside”: everything happens within that frame.</p>

  <p>That small world is complete in itself.</p>

  <p>Both in play and in musical practice, three fundamental components can be identified: the one who plays (or performs), the specific game (or the piece), and the means through which that game unfolds.</p>

  <p>In the same way as in music, the child projects their inner world into the playful activity. Play functions as a channel of inner expression: to play is a way of speaking to oneself, of externalizing who one is.</p>

  <p>There is no purpose that transcends the play itself. Its goals are contained within it.</p>

  <p>When play ends, it leaves no material trace. If it was lived with enjoyment, the child will feel somewhat more whole; if not, a little less so. Nothing more than that.</p>

  <p>Something similar happens with the musical act. When the concert ends, nothing tangible remains either. The musician has played and has managed — to a greater or lesser extent — to connect with themselves.</p>

  <p>A child who plays often comes closer to happiness. And a musician who makes music frequently and genuinely enjoys doing so also moves closer to it.</p>

  <p class="final">Does any of this resonate with your own experience?</p>

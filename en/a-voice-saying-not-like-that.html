  <h1>A voice that said: “not like that”</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    About ten years ago, when I was starting my postgraduate studies, I began to feel a very strong fear of playing.<br>
    There was no traumatic event, no extreme experience.<br>
    There was simply a voice.
  </p>

  <!-- TEXT -->
  <p>A voice that said: “mmm, no, not like that.”</p>
  <p>I heard that short sentence every time I played. Not like that.</p>
  <p>It came together with a sound: an “sss”, made by pressing my teeth together and inhaling air.</p>

  <p>When there is a voice constantly telling us that everything we do is wrong or not enough, it makes us doubt everything. I doubted everything.</p>

  <p>I was afraid in every situation where I had to expose myself: I was nervous in lessons with my percussion teacher, in chamber music rehearsals, in orchestra rehearsals, when practicing alone in a room. Always.</p>

  <p>My fellow students were much better than me. Everyone else could, and I couldn’t. My teachers were surely lying when they said that something I played was good.</p>

  <p>Praise and positive comments from colleagues and from the audience were, at that time, either lies or simply mistakes in the perception of the person saying them.</p>

  <p>I had moments in classes and internal auditions where I was so nervous and my hands were shaking so much that the only thing I wanted was for it to stop.</p>

  <p>It was a torment. And, with no alternative, I became angry with music. I decided that maybe music wasn’t for me.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I was substitute solo timpanist at Teatro Colón</li>
    <li>I was part of the Teatro Colón Orchestra Academy</li>
    <li>I graduated as a percussion teacher</li>
    <li>I was accepted into four European universities</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Could this person really not play? How did he get so far while feeling so bad?</p>

  <p>What if music wasn’t to blame for all of this? What if I felt this way for another reason?</p>

  <p>It is too much to ask music to make us feel good. Music is something else.</p>

  <p>Little by little, I began to free music from all of this, allowing myself to reconnect with what truly excites me.</p>

  <p class="final">And you — can you tell which sentence you say to yourself every time you play?</p>
